# Python freecell

## Introduction

* We will be looking at a clone for a solitaire based game known as FreeCell.
The program includes 3 classes called card, deck and notfreecell. The class holds information about a card, the deck class holds information about a deck (combination of 52 cards) and the notfreecell hold the layout of the game, the rules and how a user will be playing the game.

* Any inputs that the user will be making will be in upper case although there are checks present in the code which prompts a user if they do otherwise. The notfreecell has 8 piles, 4 cells and 4 foundations.

* As a user, you can access the piles by inputting P1, P2, P3 etc., similarly to access a cell you can input using C1, C2, C3 etc. and for a foundation using F1, F2, F3 etc. Hence, for example when a user is prompted where do you want to move the card from they can simply type P1 for instance and similarly when asked where they want to move the card to they can just enter C1
for example. 

* All inputs need to be made in upper case and the Ace card is denoted by “1”. Next, let’s now look at some of the functions that were used in the program.

* Detail information about the classes and the functions is commented in the code.
